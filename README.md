# Hkd-Hackathon-Backend

This was a project I had created for a hackathon. We created a project to analysis fraudulant transactions using a dataset with transaction data. In this data we discovered it contained Latitude and longitude data so we were able to plot this data onto a google maps API and see the where the transactions were in real time. 

This project only contained the frontend of the project however we had created a frontend web design as well as used powerBI to create interactive maps
